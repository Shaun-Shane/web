                            <p class="story-paragraph">
                                We sailed past hamlets of pastel-shaded houses with hammock-strung verandas and 
                                luxuriant gardens, often set around a simple church. Rugged green hills rose behind 
                                them, their slopes thick with orange, mango, guava, soursop and cotton trees. Beyond
                                 the site of New Westminster, founded in 1631 and now called Old Town, was Santa Isabel, 
                                 the largest of the island’s seven villages and home to a handful of municipal buildings,
                                  shops, cafes and churches.
                            </p><p class="story-paragraph">  
                                Later we called in at Crab Cay, a rocky islet in the heart of the Old Providence McBean
                                Lagoon National Natural Park, which protects an area of tropical dry forests, mangroves, 
                                coral reefs and seagrass beds on the north-east coast. A short, steep trail through a 
                                thicket of palm trees led me to a naturally formed cairn of boulders. As frigate birds 
                                – one of 150 avian species found in the park – flew overhead, I looked across at the Old
                                Providence Barrier Reef, which I’d spotted earlier that morning from the plane. Spanning
                                255 sq km and pulsing with marine life, the reef system varies widely in depth, which 
                                turns the water multiple hues of blue and green. These navy slashes, turquoise swirls and
                                azure puddles – to name just a few of the shades – have given rise to the “sea of seven 
                                colours” nickname.
                            </p><p class="story-paragraph">
                                The diving and snorkelling off Crab Cay are predictably excellent, though at around 25C the
                                water is warm enough to lull you into stupor. Within moments of submerging, turtles, octopuses
                                and shoals of minute blue and yellow fish appeared, as well as forests of anemones, 
                                constellations of starfish and clusters of brain-like coral. In the late afternoon, Williams
                                dropped me off at Southwest Bay, Providencia’s prettiest beach and site of a raucous weekly
                                horserace. I settled down at an open-side restaurant on the sand for a plate of rondón, a
                                coconut-scented stew of conch, pig tails, fish fillets, yam, breadfruit and cassava so hearty
                                that afterwards attempting to get up let alone walk felt a Herculean task.

                            <p class="story-paragraph">
                                The next morning, I caught a lift on the back of a scooter – the island’s main form of transport
                                – to Santa Isabel to explore Providencia’s piratical history. Mentioned in Robert Louis Stevenson’s
                                Treasure Island, Providencia’s most famous pirate link is with Captain Morgan, whose band of 
                                buccaneers attacked the island’s Spanish rulers in the 1660s. In 1670, they established a base
                                on Providencia and used it to launch a daring raid on Panama.
                            </p><p class="story-paragraph">  
                                According to legend, the Welsh pirate – who later in life became a slave owner, was knighted and 
                                was appointed lieutenant governor of Jamaica – stashed some treasure on the small isle of Santa 
                                Catalina, known locally as Ketlina and now linked to Santa Isabel by a rickety pontoon bridge. I 
                                followed a path along Santa Catalina’s south-west coast, which is fringed with tangled mangroves 
                                rustling with unseen creatures. Midway along, a chunky iguana crashed across a bungalow’s corrugated-iron
                                roof pursued by the broom-wielding homeowner. After 10 minutes, I reached a rusty old cannon that 
                                looked as if it had been dredged from the bottom of the sea. Known as Morgan’s Cannon, it marks 
                                the spot that Spanish soldiers once executed pirates and Puritans.
                            </p><p class="story-paragraph">
                                At the southern end of Santa Catalina, beyond a “Me ❤ Ketlina” sign, the Big Mama Sweet Taste 
                                snack shop, and an empty rum bar pumping out Damian Marley, a flight of steps led to a vantage 
                                spot overlooking the harbour. There I found the remains of Fort Warwick, built by the Puritans on 
                                the site of a former Dutch pirate base, and later captured by the Spanish. Only the formidable walls
                                of volcanic rock have survived, but it remains an evocative spot. Below, on Fort Beach, is the 
                                semi-submerged entrance to Morgan’s Cave. According to legend, this was where the legendary pirate 
                                hid his loot – though the presence of a sign pointing out the cave’s location suggested the treasure,
                                had it ever been present, was now long gone.
                            </p><p class="story-paragraph">    
                                At the far end of the cove, a dirt track wound up into a forest. Clambering over fallen trees, scattering
                                lime-green lizards in the process, I followed the trail until I reached a clearing where a bulbous chunk
                                of rock was perched precariously on a cliff edge. The landmark is known as Morgan’s Head because of its
                                supposed resemblance to the pirate; the patchy tufts of greenery on its top reminded me more of a balding
                                punk. Further on was a ruined villa rumoured to have been owned by one of Morgan’s latter-day counterparts,
                                Pablo Escobar.
